## Hi, I’m Daniel 👋  
**Unity / C# Tools & Gameplay Programmer**

I’m a Unity developer specialising in **gameplay systems, editor tooling, and production pipelines**, with professional experience shipping **mobile and PC games**.

I’ve worked as a Gameplay Programmer at Halfbrick Studios and as a freelance tools & systems developer, rebuilding legacy systems, migrating backend services, and creating scalable Unity tools used across multiple projects.

I care deeply about **clean architecture, iteration speed, and performance**, especially on mobile.
